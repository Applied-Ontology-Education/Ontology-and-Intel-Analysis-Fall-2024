This course integrates foundational principles of ontology engineering with contemporary research in intelligence analysis. To that end, we explore ontological dimensions that inform intelligence methodologies, addressing fundamental questions related to knowledge, truth, ethics, and decision-making within this domain.

The curriculum anchors theoretical concepts in practical intelligence contexts, transforming abstract ideas into actionable tools for analyzing and enhancing intelligence operations. Students will engage critically with a diverse array of topics, including the implications of digital warfare, the nature of cybersecurity in the global sphere, the ontology of terrorism, and the ethical considerations of artificial intelligence in espionage.

Students will develop a nuanced understanding of innovative applications of semantic web tools, ontologies, and knowledge graphs to intelligence analysis. The goal is for students to emerge with the ability to not only grasp but also critically evaluate and contribute to ongoing discussions and developments in the field. By the end of the course, students will be well-prepared to formulate and advocate their own informed perspectives on pressing intelligence issues.
